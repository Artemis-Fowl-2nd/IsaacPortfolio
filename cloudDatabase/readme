# Overview

I made a basic cloud database with firebase, it holds rough information about a hypothetical company's employees. 

I did this to show my experience with cloud data. 

# Cloud Database

I used firestore, a free google based cloud aplication. 

its a simple structure, one table with info about employees. 

# Development Environment

i used the dedicated graphical user iterface that firbase has for most of it, it simplified things a lot.

# Future Work


- this really could use a lot of work, its just a basic proof of concept. 
- another table with more information would be great to include.
