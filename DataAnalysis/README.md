# Overview


This is a sample analysis of a dataset about cars, from kaggle:

This is to look around the data, and show an example of what I can do. 

# Data Analysis Results

The questions and answers from the file:
What is the most expensive car, by fuel type? Electric cards are, on average most expensive. 

How much value does a car lose with mileage? About 2 cents every mile, on average. 

How much do people drive their car before selling it?
Theres a great deal of variance, but 148098 miles, on average. 


# Development Environment

I used numpy for calculations, pandas for data wrangling, and matplotlib and seaplot to generate the plots. 

This was written in python. 

# Useful Websites

These sites where helpful for this sort of project. 
* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/10min.html#min)
* [Numpy]([http://url.link.goes.here](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.polyfit.html))

# Future Work

* These could be improved by adding more data
* Attempting different approaches of analysis
* Incorporating more then the most basic of machine learning programs.
