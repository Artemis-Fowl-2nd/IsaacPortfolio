# Overview

I created a basic database for use on a simple puzzle game. 

This database is used to store information about npcs and player characters.

# Relational Database

The structure of the database is really simple. Theres a table for npcs, and a table for players. I made it so they shared a level column, so you could query and find the npcs on the same level as the player. 

# Development Environment

To run this database, I used beekeeper studio.

The language was SQLlite

# Future Work


- In the future, I will be adding actual functionality to the database, by attaching it to the game, and creating queries that way. 
- I also need to fill out the database, once my team finalizes our npcs.
